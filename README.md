This is my personal website. I built it using Go's net/http library because I wanted more freedom than I had with other frameworks.

I try to keep things simple, fast, and portable. Mostly I want iteration to be fast and development to be fun.

The goal is to have one place where I can host all my web dev projects, forever.
